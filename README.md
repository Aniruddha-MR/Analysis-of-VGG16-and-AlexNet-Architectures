# Experimental Analysis Report on VGG16 and AlexNet Architectures

This repository contains the report and findings from an experimental study analyzing the performance of VGG16 and AlexNet on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The report explores various configurations and regularization techniques to evaluate and compare model accuracy, training efficiency, and computational demands.

## Overview
The study includes:
- **Baseline Performance:** Establishing benchmark accuracy and training time for VGG16 and AlexNet.
- **Regularization Techniques:** 
  - Data augmentation
  - Dropout (with rates of 0.2 and 0.5)
  - L2 regularization (λ=0.0001 and λ=0.001)
- **Combined Techniques:** Analyzing the impact of combining data augmentation, dropout, and L2 regularization.

## Key Findings
- **VGG16** outperforms **AlexNet** in terms of accuracy and training efficiency, despite having significantly fewer parameters.
- **Dropout** is the most effective regularization technique for improving performance, especially with a 0.5 rate in VGG16.
- **L2 Regularization** shows potential but requires careful parameter tuning to avoid over-regularization.
- **Data Augmentation** increases computational costs without substantial accuracy improvements in this study.

## Performance Summary
- **Best Configuration:** VGG16 with Dropout (0.5), achieving a test accuracy of 72.97%.
- **Training Efficiency:** VGG16 demonstrates faster training times and better parameter efficiency compared to AlexNet.
- **Inference Speed:** AlexNet offers quicker inference but at the cost of lower accuracy.

## Visualizations and Interpretation
The report includes detailed visualizations for:
- Model accuracy comparison
- Training time vs. accuracy
- Regularization effects on overfitting
- Model size vs. accuracy

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights that simpler architectures with well-tuned regularization often outperform more complex models with higher parameter counts. For tasks similar to CIFAR-10 image classification, optimizing regularization strategies on VGG16-like architectures may offer the best balance of performance and efficiency.
